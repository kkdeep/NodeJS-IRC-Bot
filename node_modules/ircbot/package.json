  "readme": "NodeJS IRC bot with plugin support\n==================================\n\nHow to get it\n-------------\n\n\tnpm install ircbot\n\nOr you can clone this repo.\n\nHow to use it\n-------------\n\nCheck out `example/bot.js` for creating an instance of the bot.\n\nPlugins\n=======\n\nadmin\n-----\n\nThis plugin provides an interface for dealing with the bot via irc.  It provides the following commands: `load`, `unload`, `prefix`, `permissions`, `summon`, `banish`.  Commands by default are prefixed with `!`, though this is something you can change.\n\n### load\n\nIf you wanted to run the dice plugin on #chan1 and #chan2, and not reply to PMs, do:\n\n\t!load dice chan:#chan1,#chan2 !pm\n\nIf you wanted to have the admin plugin only work for user Joe, do:\n\n\t!load admin nick:joe\n\nIf you wanted the dice plugin to only respond to PMs, do:\n\n\t!load dice !chan\n\nIf you wanted to ban Joe and Schmoe from the dice plugin, do:\n\n\t!load dice !nick:Joe,Schmoe\n\nIf you want to block all PMs and block Joe from using the dice plugin in a chan, do:\n\n\t!load dice !nick:Joe !pm\n\nIf `chan` and `!chan`, or `nick` and `!nick` are found, the allow versions override the deny versions.  If no allow/deny parameters are specified, it will respond to all channel messages and all PMs.\n\nIf you want to load a plugin with a different prefix, do:\n\n\t!load dice cmdprefix:@\n\nFor the dice plugin only, commands that require a prefix will use `@` instead of `!`.\n\nLastly, some plugins may allow you to pass in other options.  You do this in the same format as specified above.  For example:\n\n\t!load dice cap:50\n\n### unload\n\nThis simply takes a single argument, the name of the plugin to unload:\n\n\t!unload dice\n\n### prefix\n\nUse this to change the prefix character to trigger commands that require it:\n\n\t!prefix admin ;\n\nGoing forward, if you wanted to load a plugin:\n\n\t;load dice\n\nIf dice had any prefixed commands, those would still default to `!` unless specified.\n\n### permissions\n\nThis will chance the chan and nick based restrictions similar to `load`, only it won't reload the plugin, so any state you have will be maintained.\n\n\t!permissions admin nick:joe\n\nThis will make the admin plugin only respond to someone named joe from now on.  It removes all other permissions and replaces it with what you put here.\n\n### summon\n\nThis takes a list of channels you wish to have the bot join:\n\n\t!summon #chan1 #chan2 #chan3\n\n### banish\n\nThis takes a list of channels you wish the bot to leave:\n\n\t!banish #chan1 #chan2 #chan3\n\ndice\n----\n\nThis plugin provides a die roller, and also a limited calculator along with it.  It will parse each line for dice expressions, evaluate them all, then return the results.  By default it will have a cap of 100 dice.\n\nFor example:\n\n\tJoe: I attack at [1d20+8] and deal [2d6+3] damage!\n\tBot: Joe: [1d20+8] => 13,8 => 21, [2d6+3] => 3,6,3 => 12\n\nSome games need exploding dice, which is a feature that when the maximum value of the die is rolled you get to reroll it and total the results.  The `e` and `E` operators will do this for you:\n\n\tJoe: Come on luck roll! [2e6]\n\tBot: Joe: [2e6] => 5,6,3 => 14\n\nThe exploding rolls will always follow after the die that triggered it.\n\n### Option: cap\n\nThis sets the maximum number of dice tat will be rolled before taking into account exploding dice.  The default is 100.  With the default, `[101d100]` will cause an error to be displayed.  Any chaining dice that has a result in over the cap will trigger the error, ie: `[50d50d6]` is rather likely to be well over the 100 cap.  The option argument to pass in is in the form of `cap:100`, or:\n\n\t!load dice cap:100\n\nfarkle\n------\n\nThis plugin will allow one game of farkle per channel.  When loaded, you should use the `!pm` option to block out PM use of this plugin (this is likely to be fixed in a future version).\n\nuse `!help` to learn more about this plugin.\n\nsw\n--\n\nThis is a Savage Worlds plugin that provides commands to help with that RPG system.  It has the following commands: `card`, `init`, `initshuffle`, `draw`, `shuffle`.\n\n### card\n\nThis command will display a randomly selected card from a standard deck, including jokers.  Cards are in the format of VS, where V is the value selected from A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K,A and S is a suit from D,H,C,S (Diamonds, Hearts, Clubs, Spades).  Jokers are special, in that the red and black ones are JR and JB respectively.\n\n### init\n\nThis will draw one card off of the shared initiative deck.  When it runs out it will automatically shuffle.\n\n### initshuffle\n\nThis will force the shared initiative deck to shuffle.\n\n### draw\n\nThis command without any arguments will draw one card off of your personal deck, which is tied to your current nick.  Optionally you may pass in a number of cards to be drawn.  If the cards to be drawn are greater than the number of cards left, it will shuffle first, and then draw.\n\n### shuffle\n\nThis command will shuffle the personal deck that is tied to your current nick.\n",
